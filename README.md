# Mouse_Robot
This JavaFx Project will keep your PC session active by moving your mouse (+1px-1px) with a configurable time cicle, it comes with a very handy user interface that allows you to go from extended mode (with more info) to compact mode (basic controls). I decided to create this software to avoid my computer to log off every 5M. (As per the company i work for).
