# Mouse_Robot
MEOWS:

This JavaFx Project will keep your PC session active by moving your mouse (+1px-1px), it comes with a very easy to use user interface.
I decided to create this software to avoid my computer to log off every 5M, as defined by the company i work for. Having your system auto blocked every 5-10 can be a pain.

Feel free to download this code or add anything that you think could improve this software.
